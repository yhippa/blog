Several days ago I saw [this post](https://blog.kewah.com/2021/write-more-but-shorter/) on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28483671).

I read it and it convinced me to give it a shot. The problem is that I've tried blogging so many times and never, ever got any traction. I figured "I'll get it right this time!" We will see.

Naturally as a developer I started looking at different blog platforms and hosting and there doesn't seem to be anything great out there. I ended up looking at [this post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-blog-using-a-static-site-generator-and-a-cdn/) and I gave it a whirl. I like the idea of static site generators and I've never used Netlify before so I figured I'd give it a whirl.

I finally got it up and running. There were definitely some hiccups to overcome but I pulled it off. By the time I commit this post it should be up and running. I want to write mroe but I'm going to stick to the original link's thesis of "Write More, but Shorter" and stop here.
